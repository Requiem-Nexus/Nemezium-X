    "content": "<h2>Why Design Systems Matter</h2><p>In the modern digital landscape, consistency isn't just aesthetic—it's functional. A well-architected design system serves as the single source of truth for your entire product ecosystem.</p><h3>Core Principles</h3><p>Every scalable design system is built on three pillars:</p><ul><li><strong>Atomic Components</strong> — Start with the smallest elements and compose upward</li><li><strong>Design Tokens</strong> — Abstract values into reusable variables</li><li><strong>Documentation</strong> — If it's not documented, it doesn't exist</li></ul><blockquote>The best design system is one that designers and developers actually want to use.</blockquote><h3>Token Architecture</h3><p>Design tokens are the bridge between design and code. They represent the smallest pieces of your design decisions:</p><pre><code>--color-primary: #6EE7FF;\n--spacing-md: 1.5rem;\n--font-mono: 'SF Mono', monospace;</code></pre><p>When these tokens change, everything updates automatically. That's the power of systematic thinking.</p><h3>Component Hierarchy</h3><p>Structure your components in layers:</p><ol><li><strong>Primitives</strong> — Buttons, inputs, typography</li><li><strong>Composites</strong> — Cards, forms, navigation</li><li><strong>Templates</strong> — Page layouts, flows</li><li><strong>Pages</strong> — Actual implementations</li></ol><p>This hierarchy ensures maintainability and reduces cognitive load for your team.</p>"

    "content": "<h2>The API-First Mindset</h2><p>Traditional development often treats APIs as an afterthought—a way to expose functionality that already exists. API-first flips this paradigm entirely.</p><h3>What is API-First?</h3><p>API-first development means designing your API contract before writing any implementation code. The API becomes the product specification itself.</p><blockquote>Your API is a user interface. Treat it with the same care you'd give to your frontend.</blockquote><h3>Benefits of API-First</h3><ul><li><strong>Parallel Development</strong> — Frontend and backend teams work simultaneously</li><li><strong>Better Contracts</strong> — Catch design issues before they're coded</li><li><strong>Documentation by Default</strong> — The spec IS the documentation</li><li><strong>Easier Testing</strong> — Mock servers from day one</li></ul><h3>Tools We Use</h3><p>Our API-first workflow includes:</p><ol><li><strong>OpenAPI 3.0</strong> — For specification writing</li><li><strong>Stoplight</strong> — For visual API design</li><li><strong>Prism</strong> — For mock servers</li><li><strong>Postman</strong> — For testing and collaboration</li></ol><p>The investment in upfront design pays dividends throughout the entire development lifecycle.</p>"

That's where performance budgets come in.</p><h3>What is a Performance Budget?</h3><p>A performance budget is a set of limits on metrics that affect site performance. Once set, the team must work within these constraints.</p><h3>Key Metrics to Budget</h3><ul><li><strong>Time to Interactive (TTI)</strong> — Under 3.5 seconds</li><li><strong>First Contentful Paint (FCP)</strong> — Under 1.8 seconds</li><li><strong>Total Bundle Size</strong> — Under 200KB gzipped</li><li><strong>Image Weight</strong> — Under 500KB per page</li></ul><blockquote>If you can't measure it, you can't improve it. But if you don't budget it, you won't maintain it.</blockquote><h3>Enforcing Budgets</h3><p>Budgets only work if they're enforced. We integrate checks into CI/CD:</p><pre><code>lighthouse --budget-path=budget.json --output=json</code></pre><p>If the budget is exceeded, the build fails. No exceptions.</p><h3>The Cultural Shift</h3><p>Performance budgets change how teams think. Every new feature must justify its weight. Every library import is scrutinized. This constraint breeds creativity.</p>"
